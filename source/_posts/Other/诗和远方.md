**Waterburg and Thuringian Forest, Germany**

As you admire the beauty of the Thuringian forest in Germany in today's photo, pay attention to the castle in the distance. That's Waterburg, built in the Middle Ages. Martin Luther translated the New Testament into German at Waterburg while in exile. It is the most popular tourist destination in the region and is known worldwide for its typical medieval architectural features.

The name of Waterburg comes from a play on words. "Warte" means both "watchtower" and "etc." in German. It is said that the builders of the castle exclaimed "Warte, Berg—du sollst mir eine Burg tragen!" when they saw the site, meaning "Wait, there must be a castle on this hill!" The "berg" and "burg" in this sentence mean mountains and fortresses, respectively. The name Wartburg was born.

If castles aren't your thing, the Thuringian Forest known as the green heart of Germany is also attractive. The Reynsteink Trail is Germany's oldest and most popular long-distance hike, with about 110 miles of forest spanning. On the way, you will feel the tranquility and fresh, pollution-free air here. You might even happen to crash into the small villages dotted around the area and feel their hospitality.

**瓦特堡与图林根森林，德国**

在你欣赏今天照片里德国图林根森林的美景时，请注意远处的城堡。那是瓦特堡，建于中世纪。马丁·路德流亡期间就在瓦特堡将《新约》翻译成了德语。它是该地区最受欢迎的旅游胜地，并因其典型的中世纪建筑特色而闻名于世。

瓦特堡名字的来源于一场文字游戏。“瓦特（Warte）”在德语中既有“瞭望塔”的意思，也有“等等”的意思。据说，城堡的修建者在看到这个地点时惊呼“Warte, Berg—du sollst mir eine Burg tragen!”，意思是“等等，这山上得有座城堡！”这句话中的“berg”和“burg”，分别意为山和堡垒。瓦特堡（Wartburg）这个名字就此诞生了。

如果你对城堡没兴趣，那么被称为德国绿色心脏的图林根森林也是充满吸引力的。雷恩施泰克登山道是德国最古老、最受欢迎的长途徒步路线，它在森林中蔓延约110英里。你会在途中感受到这里的宁静和清新、无污染的空气。说不定你还会碰巧撞进遍布该区域的小村庄，感受他们的热情好客。
